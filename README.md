StructuRly 0.1.0
================

**StructuRly** is an **R** package containing a [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application to produce detailed and interactive graphs of the results of a Bayesian cluster analysis obtained with the most common population genetic softwares used to investigate population structure, such as *STRUCTURE* or *ADMIXTURE*. These softwares are widely used to infer the admixture ancestry of samples starting from genetic markers such as SNPs, AFLPs, RFLPs and microsatellites (such as SSRs). More generally, **StructuRly** can generate graphs from any file containing admixture information of each sample (encoded in percentages in a range from 0 to 1). The main purpose for which **StructuRly** was conceived is to provide researchers with detailed graphical outputs to interpret their statistical results through the use of a software with a user-friendly interface, which can therefore be easily used by those who do not know a programming language. In fact, in a typical **StructuRly** output, the user will have the possibility to display information about the ID of each sample, the original membership assigned by the researcher to the sampled populations (or sub - populations) and the label of the sampling site, a variable, the latter, which is used in software for population analysis to support the data analysis algorithm. Furthermore, interactivity is a typical feature of **StructuRly** outputs, which allows the user to extrapolate even more information through a single chart.

However, this shiny application presents more different features in order to:

-   support the statistical genetic analysis with basic information about the molecular markers and diversity indeces and through the calculation of the *P*<sub>*g**e**n*</sub> (if you have haploid or diploid data) or the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for every locus. For the calculation of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the *p*-value of the *Ï‡*<sup>2</sup>-test can be calculated for any level of ploidy (&gt;= 2), while the exact *p*-value from the Monte Carlo test is currently available just for diploids (more details are available inside the [pegas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pegas/pegas.pdf) package manual);

-   upload datasets with raw genetic data to analyze them through hierarchical cluster analysis algorithms and view and download the dendrograms based on different distance matrices and linkage methods;

-   produce and customize tables ready to be imported into the *STRUCTURE* software for the Bayesian analysis;

-   import the results of the *STRUCTURE* and *ADMIXTURE* population analysis directly into **StructuRly** in different formats, without having to re-structure the dataset with other softwares (such as **R**);

-   produce an interactive barplot and triangle plot, the most well known *STRUCTURE* graphical outputs. Both graphs can show the admixture ancestry of the samples subdivided in a maximum of 20 different clusters;

-   to visually compare the partition obtained from the hierarchical cluster analysis and the one from the Bayesian analysis through a confusion matrix and estimate an agreement value of the two partitions with two different agreement indeces.

### Installation

You can install the released version of **StructuRly** from [GitHub](https://github.com) in *RStudio* with:

``` r
install.packages(pkgs = "devtools")

library(devtools)

install_github(repo = "nicocriscuolo/StructuRly", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Once the package is loaded and the dependencies installed, you can run the software in the default browser through the following functions:

``` r
library(StructuRly)

runStructuRly()
```

If you have trouble installing **StructuRly** you can follow the instructions present this [link](https://github.com/nicocriscuolo/StructuRly/blob/master/inst/Instructions_install_StructuRly.txt).

###### System requirements

**StructuRly** works on macOS, Windows and Linux operative systems. Install the updated version of [R](https://www.r-project.org) (&gt;= 3.5) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and launch **StructuRly** on all types of browsers (Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, etc.). In its current version it can also work locally and then offline. If you need any information about the usage of *STRUCTURE* or *ADMIXTURE* softwares (e. g. instructions to launch the softwares, preparation of input files and how to exports the outputs), please visit their websites at the following links:

-   [STRUCTURE](https://web.stanford.edu/group/pritchardlab/structure.html)

-   [ADMIXTURE](http://software.genetics.ucla.edu/admixture/)

Moreover, the user has the possibility to launch the Terminal (to start an *ADMIXTURE* population analysis) or the *STRUCTURE* software (if it is installed on the computer) directly from the user interface of **StructurRly** (this function is currently available for macOS and Linux users).

N. B.: If you use a Linux based machine, to properly configure **R** and to install some **StructuRly** dependencies you may need specific Linux libraries in order to make these softwares work with this operative system. To install these libraries in **R** just follow the instructions displayed inside the **R** console when you load the dependency packages.

### Data input

**StructuRly** is divided into three different sections depending on the input file chosen. For any type of file, the **header of each variable is mandatory** and varies according to the type of variable that must be present in the input dataset. When you start a new session of **StructuRly**, if you change the uploaded file with a new one (inside the same section), in order to produce new outputs remember to re-define every time type of separator and to indicate if your data have quotation marks.

###### Data format

In the first section of **StructuRly** you can import both **.txt** and **.csv** file. Since the second section accepts also the output file obtained after the population analysis performed with *ADMIXTURE*, here you can import also **.Q** format file and a **.fam** file (if the latter one is available).

In **StructuRly** you have also the possibility to export a table ready to be imported inside the *STRUCTURE* software. If you need detailed references about the structure of this dataset and how to perform the population analysis with *STUCTURE* you can find them this [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665925/). If you want to use your raw genetic data to produce an input table for the *ADMIXTURE* software, you have to convert your matrix in a **.ped** or **.bed** file. You can do that through the functionalities of the *PLINK* software, illustrated step by step at this [link](http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/data.shtml). If you need more information about this last data formats, they are available [here](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/formats#bed).

Examples of the **.txt**, **.csv**, **.Q** and **.fam** files that you can import into **StructuRly** are present at the following link of the repository: [Sample datasets](https://github.com/nicocriscuolo/StructuRly/tree/master/inst/Sample_dataset) (the .Q and the .fam files are obtained after an *ADMIXTURE* analysis with the sample files downloadable directly from the software website).

#### Section 1: Import raw genetic data

The input for this section can contain three optional variables present in the following order and whose header must be exactly the one shown below:

-   **Sample\_ID**: is the variable that contains the IDs of each sample, so each name in this column will be different from the others (although it is good practice to use only numbers and letters, the IDs characters can be separated also by the following symbols: "\_" and "-");

-   **Pop\_ID**: is a categorical variable identified by an integer that indicates the putative population defined by the user for each sample (e.g .: 1, 2, 3 ..);

-   **Loc\_ID**: another categorical variable identified again by an integer that indicates the origin site of each sample; this variable, if present in the table produced with **StructuRly** and then imported into *STRUCTURE* for population analysis, can be used by the Bayesian algorithm as a support to resutls elaboration.

The following variables present in the dataset to import in this section are mandatory, and must contain numerical values relative to the types of markers used. Depending on the ploidy of the organism analyzed, there must be a number of columns for each locus equal to the number of alleles, in particular:

-   for haploid organisms, each column must have a unique name of a locus coded with alpha-numeric characters, but it must absolutely not contain the dot symbol (e. g.: "Locus\_1", "Locus\_2", "UDO", "BRAC8792", etc.);

-   for diploid and polyploid organisms the column header must contain a single name of the locus followed, this time, by the dot symbol (".") and the identification number of the allele, mandatorily starting from 1 (e.g .: "Locus\_1.1," "Locus\_1.2", "UDO.1", "UDO.2", etc.). Below there is an image that represents data stored in a spreadsheet that, once converted in **.txt** or **.csv** format, can be properly read by **StructuRly**:

![image\_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35098432/49116039-aa40e600-f29c-11e8-82dd-05958633d416.png)

###### Missing values

When you produce the file for this section of **StructuRly**, the missing values must be indicated only with the abbreviation **NA**; the cells of the reactive table (in the table panel named "Input table") that contain missing values will appear empty, while they are codified as **-9** in the table that can be produced and downloaded by **StructuRly** to be imported into *STRUCTURE*.

N. B.: if your data refer to diploid or polyploid organisms and you encounter a missing value in one or more of your samples in a specific locus, the **NA** value must be present for all the alleles of that locus.

#### Section 2: Import population analysis

Here the user can import a dataset obtained directly following the population analysis of his genetic data. The characteristics of this input file are not very different from the one to be imported in the previous section:

-   the three optional variables (**Sample\_ID**, **Pop\_ID** and **Loc\_ID**) can be inserted again, in this precise order, within the import file, with the only difference that in this case the categories of the variables **Pop\_ID** and **Loc\_ID** do not necessarily have to be represented by numbers, but also by characters.

-   the other mandatory variables to be inserted must be those of the admixture proportion calculated by the population softwares mentioned above, and which will be equal in number to the number of clusters chosen by the user before executing the Bayesian analysis. Each of these variables must be identified by a header containing the letter "K" and the number of the relative cluster in sequence (e. g.: "K1", "K2", "K3", etc.), i. e. in the same order of the dataset exported by the software.

An example of this type of file structure is shown below (in this case the **Loc\_ID** column is not present, in fact the three information variable are not mandatory for the datasets to import in section 1. and 2.):

![image\_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35098432/49116054-b88f0200-f29c-11e8-9abf-0c050bdb1e45.png)

-   If you have obtained the results of your population analysis with the *ADMIXTURE* software, there are two ways to proceed to prepare the dataset for **StructuRly**. From the analysis of a file in **.bed** or **.ped** format you will get a **.Q** format file that you can either import into **R** and then modify as you like, exporting it in **.txt** or **.csv** format and then import it into **StructuRly** (for example, after adding the columns identifying the name of the samples or the population) or you can import directly into **StructuRly** the **.Q** format file. This file only contains the variables with the values of the ancestry admixture: if you want to add metadata to this dataset you will have to import the **.fam** file into **StructuRly**, which generally accompanies **.bed** and **.ped** files. **StructuRly** will automatically use the first two variables of the **.fam** file, which are generally used to insure the sample identifier and the user-defined population respectively.

#### Section 3: Compare partitions

The third section uses the first two sections input files to compare the partitions obtained from the hierarchical and Bayesian cluster analysis. Obviously the imported datasets must refer to data of same nature and the number of observations must be the same in both files. The samples cluster memberships of the admixture ancestry analysis partition are assigned considering the highest value of ancestry found in a specific population (*STRUCTURE* or *ADMIXTURE* cluster) for each sample. It means that this partition will divide the observations in the same number of clusters chosen for the population analysis, but if the admixture ancestry is the lowest for a particular sub-population, this cluster will not be shown in the comparison plot and table, because there are no observations assigned to it.

### Outputs download

The following image shows the main output downloaded from **StructuRly**, the barplot of the ancestry admixture. The sample labels on the X axis are colored according to the population indicated in the user input file, while the symbols at the top of the plot indicate the sampling site. In **StructuRly** there are 25 different symbols available but you can also simply decide to split the entire plot on the basis of the different categories inside the **Pop\_ID** and **Loc\_ID** variables.

![image\_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35098432/49118209-bbd9bc00-f2a3-11e8-825f-819557ecec66.png)

All **StructuRly** outputs can be downloaded as images in various high quality formats directly from the user interface. However, to download the graphs related to the Triangle plot, obtained through a specific function of the *plotly* package (and not with those of *ggplot2*) you need to download the **orca** software in your computer and follow the instructions at this [link](https://github.com/plotly/orca#installation). If you don't install the **orca** software you can always download the Triangle plot through the functionalities of the *plotly* package through the commands displayed directly on the interactive plot.

N. B.: for dataset with a high sample number (&gt; 500) remember to re-size your plot (width, height and resolution) to better distinguish the bars and the relative IDs.

### Example

Below is a link to the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/?gl=IT&hl=it) video of **StructuRly** showing an example of using of the software:

### Known bugs and issues

-   in the interactive barplot the X axis labels are not colored according to the different populations entered by the user in the input file. To view colored labels, download the image in one of the different formats available. This bug is related to the functions of a third-party package and has been reported to the GitHub community at this [link](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/issues/1328);

-   for more than 40 pre - defined populations present in the dataset to produce the barplot, the colours used to distinguish such populations within the labels of the X axis of the barplot could start to repeat;

-   in the comparison plot the separation lines of the heatmap cells are not visible when using the interactive graph for a bug present in the package used to produce this output. Again, download the output to view the complete chart;

-   when using a large number of populations (&gt; 60) or collection sites defined a priori by the user, the graphic output produced when the observations of the barplot are divided into sections according to the different populations or collection sites (or both) may not be accurate. Moreover, in this case, you could see a light overlap between the axis title and the axis text of the barplot;

The slight bugs related to some characteristics of the graphs are shown only inside the interactive plots, but the downloaded file won't present any problem.
