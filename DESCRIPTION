Description: Population genetics is essential for the analysis of allele 
  variants and frequencies within a group of individuals. Nowadays, these studies 
  are usually carried out using Bayesian clustering algorithms implemented, for 
  example, in software such as STRUCTURE, one of the most used for this type of 
  analysis. However, the graphical outputs of this application are not fully 
  informative. In this work, we developed a novel R package, StructuRly 0.1.0 
  aimed to facilitate the visualization of STRUCTURE results in an interactive way. 
  StructuRly has been implemented in R using the Shiny library and it has a 
  user-friendly interface that is simple and intuitive. The user can import 
  his genetic data, perform a hierarchical cluster analysis based on the most used 
  geometric and binary distance measures, and compare its results with the ones 
  obtained from STRUCTURE. Moreover, the user can also import the tables obtained 
  after an analysis with STRUCTURE, then visualize and personalize the barplot 
  that shows the admixture index (q) of each sample to every cluster. In addition 
  to being able to zoom and edit the graph, display information by passing the 
  cursor on the samples, the real novelty introduced by StructuRly is the ability 
  to (i) visualize the labels of each sample and (ii) group every label according 
  to the user's initial population, thus obtaining an immediate visual feedback 
  compared to the results obtained from the Bayesian analysis. With StructuRly it 
  is also possible to produce the triangle plot useful for showing more 
  specifically the degree of belonging of a sample to a certain cluster. Both 
  charts are interactive and can be downloaded in different formats. StructuRly 
  can be downloaded as an R package to be launched in any web browser.
